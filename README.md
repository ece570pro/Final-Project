# Thermal Conductivity Prediction of 2D Woven Composites

This repository contains the codebase for a data-driven framework that predicts the effective thermal conductivity of 2D woven composites using a two-step MSG-based homogenization process and artificial neural networks (ANNs). It includes scripts for dataset generation via Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS), MSG based homogenization, ANN model training, and optional deployment as an API for integration with natural language platforms like OpenAI‚Äôs Custom GPT.
